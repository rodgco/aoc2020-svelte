# Advent of Code 2020

This is my attempt to complete [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) using Svelte & Javascript. I've tried to complete it in the last few years, mostly using Ruby.

As I'm working with Svelte let's give it a try, let's see if JS is developer friendly enough to the task. And will be challenging to give a user interface to the puzzles.
